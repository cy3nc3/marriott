## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `professor-mode` — **ALWAYS ACTIVE.** The developer is a beginner. Explain the "Why" behind every concept. Use analogies. Provide the best output fitting 2026 tech standards while ensuring the user understands the underlying logic.
- `wayfinder-development` — Activates whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components. Use when importing from @/actions or @/routes, calling Laravel routes from TypeScript, or working with Wayfinder route functions.
- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing components, browser testing, debugging test failures; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `developing-with-fortify` — Laravel Fortify headless authentication backend development. Activate when implementing authentication features including login, registration, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication (2FA/TOTP), profile updates, headless auth, authentication scaffolding, or auth guards in Laravel applications.

## Conventions

- **Read-Only by Default:** You must NOT write to or edit files unless explicitly told. Provide code blocks in chat for the user to review first.
- **Style Mimicry:** Analyze the user's existing React and Laravel code. Mirror their naming conventions, indentation, and architectural patterns.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing Shadcn components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your code but **verbose in your explanation**. Focus on pedagogical value - explain why a specific React Hook or Laravel pattern is used.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

=== react & shadcn rules ===

# React & Shadcn UI

## Component Architecture
- Use **Functional Components** with Arrow Functions.
- Prioritize **Shadcn UI** for all interface elements. When suggesting a new component, provide the installation command: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`.
- Components should be modular and reusable. Explain the "Props" system to the user clearly.

## Standards
- **Mobile-First:** Styles must be written for mobile screens first using Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., `w-full md:w-1/2`). 
- **Accessibility (A11y):** All components must include ARIA labels and support keyboard navigation. Since we use Shadcn (Radix UI), ensure these defaults are preserved.
- **Hardware Optimization:** Since the user has 4GB RAM, avoid suggesting heavy client-side libraries. Keep the bundle size lean.



=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages`. Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== laravel/fortify rules ===

# Laravel Fortify

- Fortify is a headless authentication backend that provides authentication routes and controllers for Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: Always use the `search-docs` tool for detailed Laravel Fortify patterns and documentation.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `developing-with-fortify` skill when working with Fortify authentication features.
