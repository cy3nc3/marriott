0087	Heading 1	Introduction
0088	normal	Educational institutions increasingly rely on information systems to sustain efficient operations, ensure data accuracy, and support timely decision-making. However, when school processes are managed through fragmented tools (e.g., separate Excel files, Google Sheets, paper forms, and department-specific records), the organization becomes vulnerable to duplicated encoding, inconsistent records, and delayed reporting—conditions that reduce administrative effectiveness and weaken service delivery to stakeholders.
0089	normal	The operational value of integrated information systems has been emphasized across literature. According to Shah (2014), management information systems improve accessibility of information, reduce workload, and strengthen reporting quality, particularly in administrative environments where multiple processes depend on shared data. In contrast, fragmented school management information systems often lead institutions to become “data rich but information poor,” meaning that even when data exists, it is difficult to consolidate and use for action because tools are disconnected and outputs are not decision-ready. According to Forrester (2019), this problem occurs when data access is not user-friendly to policymakers and administrators, limiting real institutional learning from records.
0090	normal	In the Philippine context, modernization efforts have similarly emphasized integration. According to Balcita and Palaoag (2020), core functions such as admission, fees, and assessment must be integrated into one framework to ensure data consistency and reduce redundancy—an argument directly aligned with the realities of many local schools that still rely on manual and semi-digital workflows.

0131	normal	Statement of the Problem
0132	normal	In this part of the research, the proponents indicate the problematic areas at the Marriott School regarding student record management, financial monitoring, scheduling, and administrative decision-making. Currently, schools utilize a wide range of technology including, but not limited to, Microsoft Excel (Spreadsheets) and Google Form tools (Google Docs/Firebase), digital paper/pencil notes (Evernotes, Microsoft Words, etc...) While there are many great tools in today's educational landscape - none of them collaborate effectively when collecting data on all students' progress from one single location.. This can hinder the ability for school administrators to keep accurate financial records and track trends over time. Schools using separate, disconnected, non-integrated tools create a less than ideal situation for students, parents, and teachers.. To address these issues, the proponents propose MarriottConnect, an Integrated Student Information System with Decision Support Analytics. The purpose of this system is to streamline administrative processes, eliminate data redundancy, and provide data-driven insights for the primary stakeholders of the organization (administrators, teachers, students, and parents). 
0133	normal	General Problem:
0134	normal	How to develop MarriottConnect, an Integrated Student Information System with Automated Scheduling and Decision Support Analytics to streamline enrollment, financial assessment, and academic record management for Marriott School?
0135	normal	Marriott School faces challenges in managing student data due to its reliance upon disparate and manual/non-standardised methods and tools, resulting in a high level of fragmentation among its data management systems and processes. According to gathered data, 87% of faculty/administration use multiple systems and/or tools (i.e., physical log books to record class attendance and records for grading) to manage and share information regarding student records. The fragmentation of student record management systems and the resultant redundancies, data inaccuracies, and delayed preparation of essential reports to senior management has created significant issues for the school. As an illustration, Alex Avellano, the Academic Head, said that he found it difficult to manage the school because "The departments are all using their own Excel spreadsheets," which results in him not being able to adequately record changes and provide comprehensive reports to senior management to assist with decision making.
0136	normal	A lack of a central information system to combine the separate offices that produce and maintain academic records, tuition balances, and student schedules creates processing problems for those responsible for recording each office's information due to data loss or clerical error. Additionally, the separation of these three offices creates larger gaps in communication between the teacher, administrators, students, and parents. Consequently, Balcita and Palaoag (2020) state that if there is not a framework for integration, ways in which schools deliver services will continue to be inefficient; therefore, they recommend that a secure, digital, and centralized solution that unifies these functions with an integrated analytics system to provide information for administrators in decision-making. 
0137	normal	Specific Problems:
0138	normal	How to develop a centralized Registry and Enrollment Module that digitizes student profiling and automates the generation of school forms to eliminate the redundancy of encoding data into disparate Excel files?
0139	normal	Right now, Marriott School is relying on disjointed, manual methods and applications (e.g., Excel, Google Drive) to enter and manage important student data. Mrs. Jocelyn Cleofe, the Registrar, confirmed that enrollment remains a manual process requiring staff to "update one-by-one and double-check" across multiple files to ensure details are accurate . This redundancy is not merely inconvenient but operationally risky; Kanona (2022) argues that manual information management suffers from "low efficiency and poor security" compared to SQL-based systems. The current lack of integration results in labor-intensive manual validation processes, which wastes time generating reports and increases wait time for accurate and up-to-date information. Ultimately, the problem stems from not having a single source of truth for student data, creating severe restrictions on administrative efficiency.
0140	normal	How to develop a Cashiering and Assessment Module that automates tuition calculation, handles flexible downpayments, and detects delinquent accounts to replace the manual cross-referencing of separate ledgers?
0141	normal	The Finance Office is currently hindered by the lack of real-time tracking and automation. Mrs. Corrine Avellanosa, the Finance Officer, reported that determining a student's current tuition balance requires manually cross-referencing data from Google Drive against physical manual ledgers. She noted that "when there are multiple payments at once, there is a delay before the updated balance reflects in the system," often causing discrepancies in financial reporting . This manual verification process consumes valuable man-hours and delays the release of Statements of Account (SOA). Nitron (2024) emphasizes that modern educational institutions require tailored accounting systems integrated with student records to ensure financial transparency and operational speed, a capability currently absent at Marriott School.
0142	normal	How to develop an Automated Scheduling Algorithm that generates conflict-free class schedules by matching subject requirements with teacher availability, ensuring no faculty overlaps?
0143	normal	The resource management process is currently manual, inefficient, and prone to human error. The Registrar mentioned that checking teacher schedules one-by-one to avoid conflicts is "challenging" and time-consuming, often resulting in delays when adjustments are needed . Furthermore, teachers like Mrs. Fe Mercedes Cavitt find it laborious to locate specific records because data is scattered across different physical files and locations . Mittal et al. (2023) highlight that manual plotting is obsolete compared to algorithmic timetable generators that can automatically detect conflicts. There is a distinct problem in designing a system that can automate the allocation of these resources to prevent conflicts and optimize faculty load.
0144	normal	How to develop a Secure Stakeholder Portal that allows parents to view real-time grades, attendance, and digital Statement of Accounts (SOA) to ensure transparency?
0145	normal	Students, teachers, and parents currently utilize separate, informal access tools to obtain information, often with varying, non-standardized levels of data protection. Critically, the current system is failing parents, as evidenced by the survey where 80% of parents reported receiving school updates only 'Sometimes' (55%) or 'Rarely' (25%). This fragmentation has created substantial frustration for end-users who cannot access real-time data regarding their child's academic standing or financial obligations. Navarra and Antonio (2025) found that web-based monitoring is essential for parental engagement; therefore, there is a need for a secure, single-point portal with role-based access to empower students and parents to monitor their own, or their child's, academic progress instantly.
0146	normal	How to integrate a Decision Support System (DSS) that utilizes Predictive Analytics to forecast enrollment trends and Prescriptive Analytics to analyze financial collection efficiency?
0147	normal	Currently, the school administration lacks a mechanism for strategic foresight and relies on reactive management. Mr. Avellanosa expressed difficulty in strategic planning because the fragmented data makes it hard to generate cohesive reports . It is difficult for school administrators to view recruitment trends and financial collection trends because report formats and data from multiple departments must be consolidated manually. This inability creates difficulties for the school in forecasting what will be needed in terms of teacher recruitment and classroom preparations for the subsequent school year. Hussain, et al. (2023) and Wulandari and Pinandito, (2021) both assert that by using historical data to assist in delinquency analysis and forecasting, schools can better make high-level decisions regarding their operational requirements through the use of a system designed specifically to utilize historical information for these types of analyses.
0148	Heading 2	Objectives
0149	normal	The objectives of this study are to guide the design and development of MarriottConnect, a comprehensive student information system that addresses Marriott School's operational inefficiencies through data centralization and analytics, based on the needs validated through data gathering and supported by recent literature.
0150	normal	
0151	normal	General Objective:
0152	normal	To develop MarriottConnect, an Integrated Student Information System with Automated Scheduling and Decision Support Analytics to streamline enrollment, financial assessment, and academic record management for Marriott School.
0153	normal	This general objective is formulated to directly address the core inefficiency of Marriott School: the "siloed" nature of its operations. Balcita and Palaoag (2020) established that the modernization of school services requires a holistic framework where admission, fees, and assessment are integrated rather than isolated. By developing a unified system, the proponents aim to transition the school from a dependency on disparate Excel files to a cohesive digital ecosystem. Furthermore, the inclusion of Decision Support Analytics elevates the system from a simple repository to a strategic tool, aligning with Forrester’s (2019) assertion that schools must move from being "data-rich" to "information-rich" to improve educational decision-making. 
0154	normal	Specific Objectives:
0155	normal	To develop a centralized Registry and Enrollment Module that digitizes student profiling and automates the generation of school forms to eliminate the redundancy of encoding data into disparate Excel files.
0156	normal	This objective aims to solve the critical data retrieval bottlenecks currently experienced by the Registrar. Grepon et al. (2021) found that shifting from standalone files to a centralized network environment eliminates delays in student admission and data retrieval, a direct solution to Mrs. Cleofe's struggle with "one-by-one" updates. Furthermore, Kanona (2022) emphasizes that SQL-based management systems provide secure and efficient search capabilities compared to manual methods, ensuring that student information is accurate, easily updatable, and immediately accessible to other departments.
0157	normal	To develop a Cashiering and Assessment Module that automates tuition calculation, handles flexible downpayments, and detects delinquent accounts to replace the manual cross-referencing of separate ledgers.
0158	normal	This objective addresses the need for financial accuracy and real-time tracking identified by the Finance Office. Nitron (2024) asserts that utilizing tailored accounting systems integrated with student records is essential for modernizing educational operations and financial management. Additionally, Wulandari and Pinandito (2021) demonstrated that a decision support logic is crucial for identifying students "in arrears" (delinquent); this module will automate that identification process, allowing the administration to enforce payment policies effectively without the need for Mrs. Avellanosa to manually cross-reference three different ledgers.
0159	normal	To develop an Automated Scheduling Algorithm that generates conflict-free class schedules by matching subject requirements with teacher availability, ensuring no faculty overlaps.
0160	normal	This objectives is to provide a user friendly, less time-consuming, and more reliable way for a school to develop a timetable using technology. According to Mittal and others (2023), algorithmically generated timetables take into account all teacher availability and room capacities when creating timetables automatically, thus minimizing the time it takes to complete scheduling processes. This technology enables schools to change curricula as they happen and to develop timetables free from any possibilities for conflicts. The need for manual adjustments that can be time-consuming and challenging, as cited by interviewees.
0161	normal	
0162	normal	To develop a Secure Stakeholder Portal that allows parents to view real-time grades, attendance, and digital Statement of Accounts (SOA) to ensure transparency.
0163	normal	This objectives addresses the critical disconnect between the home and school; currently, 80% of parents believe they don't have enough information from the school. Navarra and Antonio (2025) found that parents' use of web based monitoring systems, which allow them to see their child's academic and attendance records in "real time," has a positive effect on both how engaged parents are with their child's education and how accountable the students feel for their own academic progress. Additionally, Chai and Mostafa (2021) wrote about how web-based monitoring systems enable parents to view shared records electronically, eliminating problems associated with sharing records as well as lack of transparency, therefore enhancing the relationship between the district and its stakeholders.
0164	normal	To integrate a Decision Support System (DSS) that utilizes Predictive Analytics to forecast enrollment trends and Prescriptive Analytics to analyze financial collection efficiency.
0165	normal	This goal allows for a road map in developing strategic foresight for the administration and not just as a location to store data. As referenced by Hussain et al. (2023), by using statistical methods to assess historical enrollment data, the administration can anticipate future student populations, which allows for effective resource planning (such as determining the amounts of chairs, teachers, etc., to order for the following school year). By doing so, the system provides the Academic Head with the ability to manage Data-Driven Management, alleviating their struggle of managing trend data from different Excel spreadsheets.
0166	Heading 2	Scope

0219	normal	Efficient Student Monitoring and Data Tracking System
0220	normal	Navarra and Antonio have developed and tested a new way for tracking student achievement electronically via their web-based Student Monitoring System. Navarra and Antonio's research shows that prior to implementing the web-based student monitoring system, teachers used traditional (manual) methods of keeping track of student performance using paper-based logbooks. As a direct result of using traditional methods, student performance logs were subject to many clerical errors because they were often maintained by teachers or school criminal justice officers; thus, students' parents frequently received delayed notifications of their child's performance and safety. Their findings support that digitizing student performance records such as grades and attendance improves a school's ability to quickly and efficiently intervene on behalf of students.
0221	normal	The findings of Navarra and Antonio (2025) serve as a critical reference for the Stakeholder Portal of MarriottConnect. Marriott School currently suffers from a communication gap where 80% of parents report receiving inconsistent updates. By adopting the web-based monitoring approach validated in this study, MarriottConnect can provide parents with a secure, real-time platform to view their child’s academic standing and attendance history, thereby fostering transparency and accountability between the institution and the home.
0222	normal	Optimizing Student Information Management: A Holistic Examination of Implementation Strategies
0223	normal	Nitron (2024) emphasized the necessity of a holistic approach to Student Information and Accounting Systems (SIAS) in Philippine universities. Her study highlighted that utilizing a "tailored accounting system" integrated with intelligent technologies is critical for improving educational operations, particularly in financial management. She argued that manual financial tracking is insufficient for modern institutions and that data-driven strategies are essential to align with quality education standards and improve overall academic performance.
0224	normal	This study directly supports the Cashiering and Assessment Module of MarriottConnect. Currently, the Marriott Finance Office relies on manual cross-referencing of ledgers to determine tuition balances, a process Nitron identifies as inefficient. By implementing the "tailored accounting" approach suggested by Nitron (2024), MarriottConnect will automate the assessment of fees and the tracking of payments, ensuring that financial data is accurate, integrated with student records, and readily available for administrative decision-making.
0225	normal	Designing and Implementing e-School Systems: An Information Systems Approach to School Management of a Community College in Northern Mindanao, Philippines
0226	normal	Grepon, Gumonan, Baran, and Lacsa (2021) designed a functional electronic school management system that successfully unified academic and administrative functions to support the daily operations of a community college. The paper provided deep insight into how the adoption of a centralized network infrastructure could automate complex, repetitive tasks that were originally performed manually across multiple departments. The system successfully eliminated common organizational issues such as data duplication and slow retrieval times.
0227	normal	The insights from Grepon et al. (2021) validate the fundamental architectural goal of MarriottConnect: Data Centralization. Marriott School currently struggles with disparate Excel files and Google Forms, leading to redundancy. Following the model presented by Grepon et al., MarriottConnect will transition the school from standalone files to a centralized database ecosystem, ensuring that data entered by the Registrar is immediately accessible to Finance and Faculty, thus eliminating the "siloed" operations identified in the problem statement. 
0228	normal	Building a Framework for the Integration of School Management Systems (BFISMS)
0229	normal	Balcita and Palaoag (2020) offered a powerful framework demonstrating how various school management systems can achieve better efficiency through deep integration. The authors explicitly detailed that when administrative systems are fragmented when departments operate using disconnected tools schools inevitably face data inconsistencies. Their proposed framework suggests that successful systems must offer seamless interoperation between core modules like Admission, Fees, and Academics.
0230	normal	Balcita and Palaoag’s (2020) study provides the theoretical justification for the "Integrated" aspect of MarriottConnect. It argues that Enrollment and Cashiering cannot exist as separate entities; they must be linked. This supports the proposed system logic where a student’s enrollment in the Registrar module automatically triggers the creation of their financial assessment in the Cashiering module, ensuring data consistency across the institution. 
0231	normal	Adoption and Implementation of Automated Class and Teacher Scheduler (ACTS)
0232	normal	The Department of Education (DepEd) Panabo City has implemented an automatic scheduling system for local school divisions. Before implementing this system, there was significant effort and time required by school administrators for them to manually plot their classroom schedules. The process of creating a schedule often caused confusion due to overlapping assignments between teachers and classrooms and would take an extensive amount of time each week to resolve. The use of algorithms in the automated scheduling system drastically reduced the time it took to create classroom schedules and helped reduce the incidence of errors in scheduling, such as teachers being double booked or classroom assignments overlapping.
0233	normal	This report is highly relevant to the Automated Scheduling Module of MarriottConnect. The Registrar at Marriott School described the current manual scheduling process as "challenging" and prone to conflicts. By adopting the automated logic validated in the Panabo City (2025) implementation, MarriottConnect will utilize a constraint-based algorithm to generate conflict-free schedules, thereby optimizing resource utilization and reducing the administrative burden on the Academic Head.

0235	normal	Designing Decision Support System for Midwifery Students’ Tuition Fees Problem
0236	normal	Wulandari and Pinandito (2021) focused on the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) to address financial delinquency in an educational setting. Their research utilized decision tables to identify students who were "in arrears" (delinquent) and provided management with data-driven recommendations, such as restricting exam permits or offering installment restructuring. The study proved that a DSS could significantly improve collection efficiency by automating the identification of problematic accounts.
0237	normal	This research serves as the "Hero Source" for the Delinquency Tracker and Financial Strategy Analytics of MarriottConnect. As of now, the Finance Office is performing a manual review of three ledgers to establish who has not made a payment. If the system were to include the logic in Wulandari and Pinandito’s (2021) proposal, then the system would automatically identify delinquent accounts and show trends of payments made by customers. By using this automated process, the administration can make better financial-based decisions, rather than relying on manual data mining to find this information.

0239	normal	Kanona (2022) developed a comprehensive student information management system that fully automated data handling processes across a university environment. The study highlighted the flaws of manual information management, describing it as suffering from "low efficiency, poor security, and inconvenient search." Kanona demonstrated that transitioning to an SQL-based database system ensured that student information was secure, accurate, and retrievable in seconds rather than hours.
0240	normal	Kanona (2022) supports the Database Design and Security aspects of MarriottConnect. The study emphasizes that manual files (like the Excel sheets used by Marriott School) are insecure and inefficient. MarriottConnect will adopt the SQL-based architecture recommended by Kanona to provide a secure, role-based environment where student records are protected from unauthorized access and data loss. 
0241	normal	Bright Kids Tuition Centre Management Information System
0242	normal	Chai and Mostafa (2021) developed a web-based information system for a private tuition center to manage financial records, student enrollments, and staff employment history electronically. The system was designed to resolve issues related to "record duplication" and "data inconsistency" caused by manual filing systems. Their study showed that a web-based platform allowed for the seamless sharing of records between branch managers, staff, and parents.
0243	normal	This study validates the Web-Based Architecture of MarriottConnect. Since Marriott School operates similarly to a private institution with a need for efficient record sharing between departments, the success of Chai and Mostafa’s (2021) system in reducing redundancy and improving data accessibility supports the proposal to move Marriott’s operations to a responsive web platform accessible to all stakeholders. 
0244	normal	Student Gross Enrolment Ratio Forecasting: A Comparative Study Using Statistical Method and Machine Learning
0245	normal	According to Hussain, Rosangliana & Vanlalruata (2023 ), When making predictions about student enrollment ratios, there are two types of statistical methods available. Using historical enrollment figures is an important predictor for future student populations. Using this knowledge, administrators can make informed decisions about the distribution of their workforce and space, along with hiring new teachers and opening new classrooms.
0246	normal	
0247	normal	Hussain et al.'s (2023) research is a basis for the Scientific Enrolment Forecasting feature for Decision Support Systems. As of currently, the Academic Head of the Marriott School does not have any tools available to them to see the trends that may occur. Utilizing the statistical methods outlined in Hussain et al. (2023), MarriottConnect can utilize historical data to create actionable forecasts that will support their future strategy.
0248	normal	Timetable Generator For Educational Institution
0249	normal	The author and his co-authors created a timetable generator for schools and universities automatically (Mittal et al., 2023). This paper focused on introducing the difficulties that many schools face with traditional manual timetables and noted that it is classified as "NP-Hard" and subject to human-altering errors. They proposed a system that uses algorithms to create "conflict-free" schedules by considering parameters like teacher availability, subject load, and room capacity, replacing the tedious manual plotting method.
0250	normal	Mittal et al. (2023) directly support the technical logic of the Automated Scheduling Module. Their findings confirm that manual scheduling is obsolete and inefficient for growing institutions. MarriottConnect will implement the algorithmic approach advocated by Mittal et al. to ensure that the generated class and teacher schedules are optimized and free of conflicts.

0264	Heading 2	TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
0265	normal	Overview of Current Technologies to be Used in the System
0266	normal	The proposed system, MarriottConnect: An Integrated Student Information System with Decision Support Analytics, will be constructed utilizing a robust combination of current-generation web technologies to ensure data centralization, security, and accessibility.
0267	normal	In the critical area of backend development, PHP has been selected as the primary server-side scripting language. This choice is strategic due to PHP's proven efficiency in handling complex, database-driven software systems, making it ideal for the transactional processing required for academic records and financial calculations. Correspondingly, for core data management, the system will utilize MySQL as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). MySQL is essential for providing a secure repository for the centralized school data, ensuring that the Registrar, Finance, and Faculty access a "single source of truth," thereby eliminating the data redundancy issues identified in the project’s context.
0268	normal	The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because all of today’s modern web browsers support these web standard technologies. Bootstrap will be utilized to create a responsive web interface that works well on all devices (e.g., staff desktop workstation and parent mobile phones). 
0269	normal	Official school documents, such as Certificates of Registration (COR) and Report Cards (Form 138), will be automatically generated from the school database using the FPDF library, which provides the ability to automatically fill each certificate and report card template with the school’s specific template data. Additionally, Chart.js will be used for the DSS to create visually appealing analytics and forecasting graphs relating to the school’s enrollment and financial trends.
0270	normal	
0271	normal	
0272	normal	Prototyping Model
0273	normal	The proponents will adopt the Prototyping Model in developing MarriottConnect. This methodology is highly suitable for this project as it is an iterative model that places a strong emphasis on continuous user feedback and refinement. This approach is essential to ensure that the final system aligns precisely with the validated user needs of the Marriott School administration specifically the complex financial cross-referencing and manual scheduling challenges identified during the interviews.

0279	normal	Requirements Gathering and Analysis
0280	normal	The proponents performed extensive interviews and observations at Marriott School to obtain detailed information on existing manual processes related to enrollment, grading, and tuition collection. This step builds on the findings from the data collection (e.g., interviews with Mrs. Cleofe regarding manual sectioning and Mrs. Avellanosa regarding ledger cross-referencing) to fully understand the current pain points. The data was analyzed to determine the key gaps in operations and to create clear, measurable objectives for the Integrated System. 
0281	normal	
0282	normal	Quick Design
0283	normal	Based on the finalized requirements, a preliminary design of the system's interface and data flow was created. This rapid design phase focused on the architectural blueprints and user experience (UX) for the system's major modules: Registry, Cashiering, Grading, and the Analytics Dashboard. This initial design prioritized logic and functionality such as the flow of data from enrollment to billing over final aesthetics. 
0284	normal	Build Prototype
0285	normal	A functional, albeit partial, prototype of MarriottConnect will be developed using the selected technologies (PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap). This prototype will demonstrate basic, core functionalities deemed most critical by the users, such as the "Flexible Downpayment" entry for Finance, the "Constraint-Based Scheduler" for the Admin, and the "Digital Gradebook" for teachers. 
0286	normal	Initial User Evaluation
0287	normal	The built prototype will be presented to Marriott School's administration and key staff (Registrar, Finance Officer, and Academic Head) for hands-on evaluation. Their critical feedback will be gathered to identify specific areas that require modification for instance, ensuring the printed COR matches the exact school template or refining the delinquency flagging logic. This stage ensures the system meets the practical needs highlighted in the initial analysis. 
0288	normal	Refining Prototype
0289	normal	The software will be incrementally refined with user input, with a primary emphasis on enhancing the User Interface Design and Improving System Performance through speed and the accuracy of the Core Algorithm, Linear Regression for Forecasting Enrollment numbers. This cycle will continue until the software has been fully validated by the users.

0407	Heading 2	Requirements Documentation
0408	Heading 2	The MarriottConnect system, an Integrated Student Information System with Decision Support Analytics for Marriott School, is composed of multiple integral modules designed to interoperate seamlessly. These modules are key components in achieving efficient, organized, and data-driven management of student data and communication related to all aspects of school and student operations.
0409	Heading 2	Educators can manage their student's academic records using module grades and academic records. Educators can input raw scores for written works and performance tasks; the system calculates the final weighted grades automatically. Students and parents will be granted easy access to view comprehensive academic information for each grading period through a secure portal.
0410	Heading 2	Alongside this is the Cashiering and Assessment Module that automates the recording of tuition fees, payment transaction information, and balances owed. This module replaces the manual cross-referencing of ledgers by automatically calculating assessments based on grade level and accepting flexible downpayments. It creates a clear financial record available to students or parents so they understand what they owe to the institution and can make timely payments, while also flagging delinquent accounts to restrict the release of report cards.
0411	Heading 2	Furthermore, the Automated Scheduling Module provides the administration with a powerful tool to generate conflict-free class timetables. Using a constraint-based algorithm, the matching of Subject Requirement to Instructor Availability is done in a way that prevents overlapping of Single Subject Instructors. After the matching process is completed, both Students & Instructors receive access to an organized Schedule that displays each Student's Assigned Subjects, Days of the Week, Class Times, and based on Teacher Listings, who will be teaching each Course.
0412	Heading 2	In addition, the Attendance Module digitizes the entire attendance process. Administrators can now track daily student attendance using a digital system instead of the traditional use of paper log books. By utilizing a live database, staff will be able to view daily attendance patterns as they develop as opposed to waiting until the quarter grading process is complete to see the attendance patterns. Furthermore, with this technology, parents and district office personnel will have access to the same accurate attendance data for their children.
0413	Heading 2	Beyond mere record-keeping, MarriottConnect incorporates the Stakeholder Portal to enhance communication between the school and the family. Through the Parent Portal, parents have access to immediate and ongoing updates regarding their child’s academic progress. This includes real-time views on received grades, attendance records, and their digital Statement of Accounts (SOA). In addition to these features, parents can utilize the Ticketing System located within the Parent Portal to communicate directly with any of the departments (Finance, Registrar or Academic) from whom they need help. This process allows parents to receive updates on their tickets and be assured that their issues will be handled properly and efficiently by the appropriate department.
0414	Heading 2	At the centre of the system is the Registry and Enrollment Module (REM), which is the database that contains all student information (demographics, enrolment information, and academic history). REM also simplifies the admission process by facilitating New, Returning, and Transferee workflows as well as allowing users to automatically assign sections, although users can override this function if they choose.. This module ensures that administrators and authorized faculty members have access to accurate, current files on any student when required.
0415	Heading 2	For strategic planning, the Decision Support System (DSS) & Analytics Module enables administrators to view visual dashboards forecasting enrollment trends and analyzing financial collection efficiency. By using predictive analytics on historical data, the administration can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and financial strategy.
0416	Heading 2	For data reporting, the Reports Module enables administrators to prepare summary reports on academic performance, tuition balances, and enrollment statistics. These generated reports are designed to be easily exportable and formatted according to the school's official templates (e.g., Certificate of Registration, Form 137/138) for administrative records and review.
0417	Heading 2	Ultimately, the System Maintenance & Security Module is put in place to guarantee the on-going element of trust and continued function of the ongoing system. This module will permit authorized Super Administrators to manage end-user accounts, configure school years, and view audit trails. This control process is critical for ensuring data integrity, system security, and overall access to function is limited to authorized personnel only.
0418	Heading 2	By applying the full configuration of these integrated modules, MarriottConnect will be configured to create a thorough, centralized, and automated system to ease school operations and substantially build connectivity between the Marriott School, its students, and their families.
